Test Certificates
=================

While the certificates needed to run the test are already in this directory,
they can be regenerated by running `./cert_gen.sh`.

**NOTE**: The redoctober certificate must be valid for both `localhost` and
`redoctober`. The `redoctober`'s network is exposed both to the host at
`localhost:8080` so that `test.sh` can `curl` endpoints on the redoctober
server, and also on the internal inter-container network at `redoctober:8080`.
Thus, the certificate must be valid for both domain names.
